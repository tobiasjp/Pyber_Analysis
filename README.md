# Pyber_Analysis

## Overview

The CEO of PyBer has requested data regarding ride sharing for Urban, Suburban, and rural city types.  The data is expected to show differences in number of drivers for each city type, number of rides per city type, and average fare per city type.   This data will be used by decision makers at PyBer and must be correct.

## Resources

Software : Python 3.7, Jupyter Notebook
Data Files: city_data.csv, ride_data.csv


## Analysis & Results

### Analysis and Results of Total Rides 
By performing a calculation of all rides taken by the data, based on the city type, we were able to determine the total number of rides by each city type:
- Urban cities had the most total rides with 1,625 total rides.
- Suburban cities had less than half of the number of Urban rides with 625 total rides.
- Rural cities had the least amount of rides with 125 rides in total.

### Analysis and Results of Total Drivers
By performing a calculation of all drivers in each city, we were able to group together the total number of drivers for each city type:
- Urban cities had the most drivers with 2,405 drivers.
- Suburban cities had less than hald of the number of drivers than Urban cities with 490 drivers.
- Rural cities had the least amount of drivers with 78 total drivers.


### Analysis and Results of Total Fares
By calculating the total number of fares, and grouping the fares by city type, we were able to conclude:
- Urban cities produced the highest share of all revenue with $39,854.38.
- Suburban cities produced about half of the revenue of urban cities with $19,356.33.
- Rural cities produced the lease amount of revenue with $4,327.93.

### Analysis and Results of Average Fare per Ride
By taking the sum of each city types' total revenue and dividing by total number of rides, we were able to conclude:
- Rural cities had the highest average fare per ride with $34.62 per ride.
- Sububuran cities had almost as high an average fare as rural cities with $30.97 per ride.
- Urban cities had the most inexpensive average fare with $24.52 per ride.


### Analysis and Results of Average Fare per Driver
By taking the sum of each city types' total revenue and dividing by total number of drivers, we were able to conclude:
- Drivers in rural cities had the highest average fare per driver with $55.49 per driver.
- Drivers in sububuran cities produced 16 dollars less on average per driver than rural cities with $39.50 per driver.
- Drivers in urban cities had the most inexpensive average fare per driver with $24.52 per driver.

### Analysis and Results of Total Fare by City Type
By summarizing the fares for each week from 1-1-2019 - 4-28-19, by city type, we can conclude:
- Urban areas produced the most amount of revenue between this time period.
- Suburban areas produced less than half of the revenue between this time period.
- Rural areas produced the least amount of revenue between this time period.

## Summary

Based on the data, we can conclude:
- Urban areas have the most amount of drivers and produce the most amount of revenue.
- Although fares in rural cities are higher per driver and per ride, Urban areas have significantly more rides and more drivers.  The cost of each ride in a urban areas is less, but the volume of rides produces more revenue than suburban and rural areas combined.
- By reevaluating each individual area, a focus can be placed on increasing productivity in urban areas, and reducing the business in suburban and rural areas, as they do not produce as much revenue.
